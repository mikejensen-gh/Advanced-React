# imports are not native to graphql, but prisma has added import functionality. imports are written in comments below, and let us access everything from prisma.graphql, so we don't have to rewrite stuff 1:1 (e.g. for returning the Item type below)
# import * from './generated/prisma.graphql'

type Mutation {
  createItem(title: String, description: String, price: Int, image: String, largeImage: String): Item!
}

type Query {
  items: [Item]!
}
